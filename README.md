# Mat-s-Mons

**Description:**
Welcome to Mat's Mons! A website that presents a collection made by a Pokemon card collector who enjoys selling and showing off his latest pulls! If you would like to traverse through the website, be sure to use the sorting buttons and filter drop-down menus to see the diverse selection of Pokemon card types and stages. The cards' costs are also included. 

**Reasoning with why I made this website**: 
In this website, I have decided to make one based off of Pokemon cards. Ever since I was a kid, I had a fascination of them. This led me to collect the Pokemon cards, as well as learn how to play the game itself. Of course, over the years, I started to lose interest in Pokemon cards and sealed them all in my garage. As soon as I started to lose interest, so did the public, resulting in a halt with its popularity. However, for some reason, Pokemon cards started to get a lot more popular than usual, and groups of new audiences began to form. With this uprising on Pokemon cards, I decided to make a catalog website with a product I had history with.
